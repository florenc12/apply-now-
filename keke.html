                        understands that communication is social, political, and media-based, and occurs in different contexts. Communication <br>
                        studies is an interdisciplinary major that consists of a number of interrelated subfields: popular communication,<br>

                         and philosophy of communication. Each subfield explains specific communication problems, but they are linked by a <br>
                         shared set of overlapping academic debates. These debates include: qualitative and quantitative methods (including the<br>
